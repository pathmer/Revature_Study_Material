### Class Relationships
> OOP seeks to, whenever possible, eliminate redundant or repetitive code. It want to promote code re-use.  

- A class can: 
    - "Inherit" states and behaviors from another
        - IS-A relationship (IS-AN)
    - create or contain an instance of another class
        - HAS-A relationship (HAS-AN)
        - a.k.a **Composition** or **Composite Relationship**
